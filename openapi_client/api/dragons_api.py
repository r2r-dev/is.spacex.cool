The names SpaceX as well as related names, marks, emblems and images are registered trademarks of their respective owners.*  ## Base URL The most current version of the API is v3, with the following base URL `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3`  ## API Status See the [status](https://status.spacexdata.com) page for details  ## Authentication No authentication is required to use this public API  ## JSON Field Masking Smaller JSON payloads can be generated through the use of the `filter` querystring. When using this querystring, all fields not included in the query will be omitted from the response.  For example, on the launches endpoint, you could include `filter=flight_number` to only return the flight number of every launch. Nested JSON fields can be expressed using a forward slash for each nested level. Ex: `filter=rocket/second_stage/payloads` to only return the payload objects from each launch. Multiple filters can be listed using a comma separator Ex: `filter=rocket/second_stage/payloads,flight_number,mission_name`.  More information on the syntax can be found on the json-mask [github](https://github.com/nemtsov/json-mask) page.  ## Pagination All endpoints that return an array of objects can be paginated by using the `limit` and `offset` querystrings. This allows you to limit results and create pages of results to offset or skip.  On all endpoints that return an array, the header `spacex-api-count` is included with the total number of items in the array. This can be used to page through the results. By default, there is no limit set.  For example, the url `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches?limit=1&offset=5` will only return launch #6, because we limited the results to a single launch, and skipped the first 5 launches using offset.  ## Pretty Printing JSON pretty printing is turned off by default to reduce payload size. It can be enabled by including the querystring `pretty=true` in the url. ```http GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/latest?pretty=true ```  ## Privacy I do not log IP addresses or any personally identifiable information at the app or web server level. I collect timestamps, HTTP methods, urls, and response times to adjust caching strategies on popular endpoints. Below is a sample log line output: ```bash [27/Aug/2018:00:42:06 +0000] \"GET /v3/launches/latest HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 51.478 ms ```  I use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in front of the API. Please see their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more details on data collection policies.  ## Rate Limiting The API has a rate limit of 50 req/sec per IP address, if exceeded, a response of 429 will be given until the rate drops back below 50 req/sec  ## Caching In general, the standard cache times are as follows:  * launches - 30 seconds * ships, payloads, roadster - 5 minutes * capsules, cores, launchpads, landpads - 1 hour * dragons, rockets, missions, history, company info - 24 hours  ## Date field FAQ's Dates and Date related field explanations:  `launch_year` - Year of the launch in string form (Will be deprecated soon)  `launch_date_unix` - UTC launch date/time as a UNIX timestamp in seconds  `launch_date_utc` - UTC launch date/time in ISO 8601 format  `launch_date_local` - Local launch time with time zone offset in ISO 8601 format  `is_tentative` - Set as true until a launch has an time attached to the date  `tentative_max_precision` - Gives the current known precision for the launch date. Valid values are `quarter`, `half`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`. This allows us to give more context when representing partial dates like `November 2019` with a precision of `month`  `tbd` - Set as false when the date includes a day number or a day number with a time, otherwise the date is considered to be TBD and set as true  `upcoming` - Set as true until the moment of launch  `static_fire_date_utc` - UTC date/time for the rocket static fire test in ISO 8601 format  `static_fire_date_unix` - UTC date/time for the rocket static fire test as a UNIX timestamp in seconds  # noqa: E501
